# Assignment: Escape the Prison
In this assignment, our character is in a prison, and we need to follow specific steps to rescue them. If the return values are sequenced as 1-2-3-4-5-8-6-7-11-13-9-14-10-13-15-12, the character will be saved.

Briefly, the steps are:

Distract the guard at the door.
Go to the bathroom and find a coin.
Clog the toilet.
Interact with the guard again to escape from him.
Bribe the guard at the exit door with the coin.
The game can be played by entering the inputs manually or by using the Depth-First Search (DFS) method, which is the main objective of the assignment.

# Assignment: MID's and Graph

In this assignment, a graph was created similar to the one constructed by Wikipedia, and the relations therein were analyzed. MIDs and their corresponding names were used to create the graph based on relations between two MIDs. Subsequently, the number of neighbors for any MID in the graph, the shortest distance between any two MIDs, and the top 10 most central MIDs were determined.
